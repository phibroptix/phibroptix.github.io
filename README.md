## Welcome to My Page

I don't have much here atm, but if you come back once I've decided to get around to changing/updating this page, who knows what it'll look like!

### About Me

Everyone's favorite topic is always themselves, it is quite easy for others to grow weary so I'll try and keep this short.

- I am a budding C++ programmer
- I have experience in linux and networking
- I have come into some free time and would love to get involved in helping however I can
- In this process I may require a bit of hand-holding, but I expect I will grow out of it quickly and be able to be a productive member of society at a point nearer than most would believe
